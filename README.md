Voice Echo is an intelligent pipeline that converts raw audio input into concise and meaningful summaries. This project combines the power of automatic speech recognition (ASR) and natural language processing (NLP) to transcribe spoken words into text and then generate summarized versions of that content.

🚀 Key Features
🎙️ Speech-to-Text Conversion: Utilizes a lightweight ASR model to transcribe audio into accurate text. (e.g., Vosk for offline and multilingual support)

✂️ Text Summarization: Applies state-of-the-art NLP techniques to extract and condense key information from the transcription.

🔄 End-to-End Pipeline: From microphone input or audio file to final summary — all in one streamlined workflow.

📦 Modular Design: Easy to integrate, customize, and extend for other domains like lectures, meetings, or podcast processing.

🧠 Technologies Used
Python

Vosk (or your ASR tool)

NLTK / spaCy / Transformers (for NLP and summarization)

Flask / Streamlit (optional for UI or API deployment)

📌 Use Cases
Transcribe and summarize lectures, meetings, or interviews

Create digestible notes from long-form audio

Enhance accessibility for hearing-impaired users

Preprocess speech data for NLP tasks
